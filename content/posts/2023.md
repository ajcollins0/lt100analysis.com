# The 2023 Leadville 100

In 2023 I particpated in the leadville 100. Post race I was curious about the correlation between the time people arrived at an aid station vs the overall finish time. This analysis is an attempt at chasing that curiousity and I hope you find it as interesting as I did!

## Finisher Percentage

Overall the finisher percentage was 46.28. The breakdown across gender identities is shown in the above photo.

## Buckets

In order to compare finish times against aid station times, we need to bucket particpants into groups that can be used for comparisons. The above photo shows the amount of particpants in each bucket. The x axis denotes a finish time, where dnf means "did not finish". Since the race has a 30 hour cutoff, each bucket is defined as a 1 hour window. 

It is noticible that finishing at 27 hours and below shows a large drop in particpants per bucket. This is likely where the more elite runners are finishing due to this course's difficulty. A 27 hour finish time would also mean a 16:12 average pace per mile.   

## Aid stations

The next few graphs will be comparing the time to get to each aid station from the start of the race against each bucket. This is done using a box plot to denote the variability within each bucket.

### Mayqueen outbound

The DNF group in the above photo has a fairly wide variability. The super elites are getting to this aid station in around 1:45 ...astonishingly fast to start a 100 mile effort. Every finishing bucket has a higher quartile value that is sub 2:30. This means that 2:30 should most likely be a "fallback" time to get to mayqueen rather than a target time. The big belt buckles (sub 25 hours) have a median value that is around 2:00.

### Disclaimer

All data used in this analysis was freely available on the internet. No guarentees have been made about this analysis or its accuracy. I know there is some missing entries(100-150) from the total particpants, so this is a rough estimate of the total number of entries. All split times are unofficial.
