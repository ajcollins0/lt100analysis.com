          The 2023 Leadville 100 # In 2023 I particpated in the leadville 100. Post race I was curious about the correlation between the time people arrived at an aid station vs the overall finish time. This analysis is an attempt at chasing that curiousity and I hope you find it as interesting as I did!
Finisher Percentage # Overall the finisher percentage was 46.28. The breakdown across gender identities is shown in the above photo.
